This function takes two or three arguments. The first argument must be the histogram structure (a subtype of AbstractHistogram). The second and optional third argument(s) must be the data to operate on. The type of the histogram determines whether one or two additional arguments are needed. For example, a 2D histogram requires two additional arguments. A typical 1D histogram requires only one.\n\nImplementations of this function are free to implement any optimizations they wish as long as the histogram is correct once this function exits. This function is not required to be thread-safe. Implementations are encouraged to create descriptive names for their subtypes of AbstractHistogram that describe which optimizations are implemented. For example, SingleThreadFixedWidth2DHistogram does not implement thread-level parallelization by design.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#FastHistograms.counts","page":"Home","title":"FastHistograms.counts","text":"Returns the count in each bin of the histogram.
